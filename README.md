# Robotic Hand Control Using Arduino and Computer Vision

This innovative design is powered by an Arduino microcontroller, which controls the servo motors responsible for the handâ€™s movements. Each finger is connected to a servo via thread, allowing precise movements as the servo pulls the strings.

What makes it even more fascinating is the integration of camera vision. Using OpenCV and Mediapipe, the system detects hand movements and tracks the angle changes of each finger in real-time. The camera feeds this data to the Arduino, enabling seamless interaction between the userâ€™s hand and the robotic hand. ðŸš€

A small step towards sustainable tech, a big leap in innovation!
